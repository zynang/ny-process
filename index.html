                <p>
                    In this project, I set out to redesign the homepage of my high school's (Nanyang Girls' High School) website. This school is home to all of my fondest memories, and I do not think that her current website adequately captures all the joy, creativity, and excellence that she inspires. 
                    It is currently a visually uninteresting website, and it also fails to highlight key information that primary users would be interested in.

                    <h3>Problems with the existing design</h3>
                    <p>The school website primarily serves as a point of information and a collection of resources for 3 groups of users: </p>
                    
                        <ul>
                            <li>Prospective students and parents: Interested in curriculum, experiences and history (Main User)</li>
                            <li>Current students: Interested in quick links and history of school for class projects </li>
                            <li>Alumni: Interested in quick links and history of school for heritage projects </li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>As such, my comments about the website's existing design revolve around its ability to respond to the needs of these identified users. I have organized my comments around the principles of Efficiency, Learnability and Memorability.</p>

                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Efficiency</th>
                            <th>Learnability</th>
                            <th>Memorability</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        The navigation bar organizes the website’s information into useful groupings for the primary users, making it easy for them to find quick links to related sites.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        However, the homepage is not efficiently utilized for access to key information. Space is wasted on information that primary users are not interested in, such as 'News', ‘Our Partners’ and ‘Our Educational Alliances’. Primary users are aware of the school’s reputation and would prefer to quickly access specific information about the curriculum, heritage and history of the school instead.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        On a positive note, announcements are prominently displayed on the homepage. This makes it easy for the relevant users to get the information they need.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
    
    
                            </td>
                            <td>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        The body of the homepage is poorly utilized and makes it difficult for new users to find the information they need. 
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        The clickable elements of the website are not easily identified, and the buttons are poorly designed (overly-small font size, no distinct background, easily overlooked).
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Despite being a bicultural school focused on Chinese immersion for its students, the website does not include an accessible Mandarin version for users. </li>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                                The URL for the website is (https://en.nygh.moe.edu.sg/), and the “en” at the start of the URL suggests that there may be a non-English version of the website available, but a button to access that option cannot be found anywhere on the homepage.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                [Update as of 4 Mar – a Mandarin toggle has newly appeared on the webpage]
                                            </li>
                                                                           
                                    
                                </ul>
                            </td>
                            <td>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        The interface is very unmemorable. It reads like a standard template from a website builder (e.g. Wix), with few elements of visual interest. 
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        The hero image is boring. It is the school's facade, and does not convey any useful information about the school.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                       Based on the contents of the homepage, the bicultural nature of the school is not immediately obvious. This reduces the website's memorability, since there is a disconnect between the webpage and the school's reputation.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </td>

                            <h4>Assessment of WAVE's appraisal</h4>
                        
                            <p>WAVE was largely accurate in its detection of problems, except for the incorrect detection of empty links (the links were present).</p>
                            <p>
                                The lack of a heading for the landing visual and alternative texts for some images was particularly concerning. These findings reveal an inaccessible design-- the absense of a heading and alternative text prevent screen readers from conveying an accurate audio description of the website to users.

                <p>As part of my redesign process, I started by hand-sketching new homepage wireframes.</p>
                <div class="sketches">
                    <h3>Quick Sketching</h3>
                    <p>The first exercise I did was to generate 9 different wireframes within the span of 9 minutes. This was a great exercise in forcing myself to abandon any desire for "perfection" and focus mainly on creating a new design with each iteration.</p>

                    <h3>Final Sketch</h3>
                    <p>After creating 9 designs, I combined my favourite elements into one final redesign. This design had a dynamic landing visual that showcased "The Nanyang Experience" (a carousel of photographs of students engaged in their passions), as well as easily accessible information about the school's curriculum and story/history.</p>

                <p>With my basic wireframe complete, I created a style guide for my website redesign.</p>
                <p>For colors, I picked the school colors-- Blue, Yellow and White, in varying shades and tones.</p>
                <p>For the font, I wanted a serif accent font for the page headers, subheaders and titles (Lora) and a standard sans serif font for the content (Inter). I used a formula [calc( ?px + ?vw)] to set the font size, so that the font would scale with the width of the user's screen, yet preserve a minimum font size for smaller screens, such as mobile phones.</p>
